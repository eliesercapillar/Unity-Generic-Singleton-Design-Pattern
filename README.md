# Unity-Generic-Singleton-Design-Pattern
This project contains boilerplate code that can be expanded upon whenever using the [Singleton Design Pattern][SingletonDP] in new Unity Projects. The singletons that exist in this package include:
- Generic Singletons
- Persistent Singletons
- Regulator Singletons

## Credits
These scripts were made with the help of Adam Myhre's amazingly informative youtube channel, [git-amend][Youtube]. If you haven't already seen it, definitely check out [Adam's Generic Singletons][Repo]!
This repository is for my convenience and I will modify these scripts to fit my use cases specifically.
